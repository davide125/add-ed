To do:
# Small fixes
 # widespread small
- Look over raw mode handling for error printing.
 - Requires updating or removing our debug printouts.

- Look over all TODO comments in the repo.


 # In cmd/mod.rs
- Fix the movement variations in 'm' and 't' commands

- Check our flag handling, allow no invalid flags!

- Validate selection even when no command given, currently sets that selection even though error results.

- Look over which commands to print view after.

+ Allow opening a non-existent file for editing, but not appending it to current buffer.

- Return error if fail to parse filepath for 'e', 'E', 'r'?


 # In buffer.rs
- Convert into using error_consts.rs, so that error printing in raw mode works.

- Fix so that regex is configured for multiline etc.

- Handle any combination of \r and \n to mark newlines, (aka. DOS and mac text encoding)


 # in ui/input.rs?
- Add some escape sequences to our input (\n most importantly, thus also \\).


# Printing fixes
- Unify printing logic into one function. (Later branch)

- Make printing handle tab.

- Update printing from 'f' command for raw mode.
