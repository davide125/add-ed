To do:
# Small fixes
- Look over raw mode handling for error printing.

- Fix the movement variations in 'm' and 't' commands

- Fix so that regex is configured for multiline etc.

- Add some escape sequences to our input (\n most importantly, thus also \\).

- Check our flag handling, allow no invalid flags!

- Validate selection even when no command given, currently sets that selection even though error results.

- Handle any combination of \r and \n to mark newlines, (aka. DOS and mac text encoding)

# Printing fixes
- Unify printing logic into one function. (Later branch)

- Make printing handle tab.
