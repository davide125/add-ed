#To do:


 # Somewhere:
- Create a testing macro for buffer implementations.


# Do in UI fixup branch?
 # in ui/input.rs?
- Have some way to go back in command history (up-arrow in command input).

# Printing fixes
- Make view closer to centered on selection?

- Skip newline before first printed line.

- Add separator before printout.

- Reduce goal view-size, so that preceeding command is visible?

- Unify printing logic into one function. (Later branch)

- Make printing handle tab.
