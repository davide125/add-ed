#To do:


 # Somewhere:
- Create a testing macro for buffer implementations.

 # In cmd/mod.rs
- Check our flag handling, allow no invalid flags!

- Validate the selection when interpreting it, currently no command can set invalid selection.

- Look over which commands to print view after.

- Return error if fail to parse filepath for 'e', 'E', 'r'?


# Do in UI fixup branch?
 # in ui/input.rs?
- Add some escape sequences to our input (\n most importantly, thus also \\).

- Have some way to go back in command history (up-arrow in command input).

# Printing fixes
- Make view closer to centered on selection?

- Skip newline before first printed line.

- Add separator before printout.

- Reduce goal view-size, so that preceeding command is visible?

- Unify printing logic into one function. (Later branch)

- Make printing handle tab.
