#To do:

 # Somewhere:
- Create a testing macro for buffer implementations.

# Do in UI fixup branch?
 # in ui/input.rs?
- Have some way to go back in command history (up-arrow in command input).

# Printing fixes
- Unify printing logic into one function. (Later branch)

- Make printing handle tab.
