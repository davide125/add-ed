## The ed rewrite for daily use

After tiring of emacs freezing up on me one time too many and concluding that vim isn't any less of a monstrosity I made the reasonable choice and started using ed.
It was a bit frustrating at the start but grew to be quite nice. The only missing feature really being syntax highlighting. After some research I couldn't find any ed fork or clone with syntax highlighting, so I once again made the reasonable choice and wrote my own.
And so here it is, with all its flaws and deficiencies. Any and all pull requests welcome.
