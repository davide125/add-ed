# Todos:
- Add toggling versions of 'n' and 'l' ('N' and 'L')?
- Make no command equate z{sel.1 - sel.0 + 1}
- Create default selection on startup if possible?
- Make 'i' and 'a' work without given index on empty buffer, default sel?
- 'J' to reflow to width? Maybe?
- Maybe macros soon? Command line flag, if we don't want to go for a config.
