# Todos:
- Make no command equate z{sel.1 - sel.0 + 1}
- 'J' to reflow to width? Maybe?
- Maybe macros soon? Command line flag, if we don't want to go for a config.
- Add some way to show what lines are tagged with what char.
- Shell interaction. ('!' as usual, '|' pipes selection, accepts '>' '2>' '&>')
